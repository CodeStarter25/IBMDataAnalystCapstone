This repository contains the complete work and labs from my **Capstone Project** for the IBM Data Analyst Professional Certificate. It showcases the **skills, techniques, and tools** I‚Äôve developed to **manipulate, clean, and visualize data** throughout the course.

## üìå Project Overview


### üîπ Introduction

As part of this capstone, I assumed the role of a Data Analyst at a global IT and business consulting firm. The company is focused on staying competitive in the rapidly evolving tech landscape by regularly analyzing data to forecast **emerging and in-demand skills**.


### üîπ Role & Responsibilities

My primary objective was to collect, analyze, and visualize data from diverse sources to support this year‚Äôs internal report on in-demand developer skills. Key data sources included:

* Job postings
* Training portals
* Developer surveys (e.g., **Stack Overflow Developer Survey 2024**)

Once collected, I processed the data using **data wrangling**, conducted **exploratory data analysis**, and visualized the results using **Google Looker Studio**. The final deliverables include a presentation highlighting the trends and a dashboard built using BI tools.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Skills & Tools Applied

* **Web Scraping** with `BeautifulSoup`
* **REST API** integration
* **Python Libraries**: `Pandas`, `NumPy`, `Seaborn`, `Matplotlib`
* **Data Cleaning** and **Wrangling**
* **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
* **Data Visualization** using:
  * Google Looker Studio
  * Matplotlib & Seaborn (custom plots)
* **Country Standardization** using `pycountry` (Alpha-3 country codes)

---

## üìä Key Themes Explored

* Most in-demand programming languages
* Popular and emerging database technologies
* Frequently used platforms and web frameworks
* Developer demographics and satisfaction levels
* Global salary and location-based discrepancies

## ‚ú® Highlights to Explore

To quickly see the core of my skills and approach, I recommend checking out:

[Lab 21](https://github.com/CodeStarter25/IBMDataAnalystCapstone/blob/main/Lab_21_Pie_Charts.ipynb): Features a custom function I developed to dynamically create all pie charts from Task 2, showcasing my ability to write reusable, efficient code.

[Presentation PDF](https://github.com/CodeStarter25/IBMDataAnalystCapstone/blob/main/IBM_DA_Capstone_Presentation.pdf): Detailed insights and visual storytelling demonstrating my data interpretation and communication skills.

[Dashboard PDF](https://github.com/CodeStarter25/IBMDataAnalystCapstone/blob/main/IBM_Capstone_DashBoard.pdf): Interactive reports built with Google Looker Studio, highlighting my proficiency in data visualization tools.

The final labs: These labs showcase the best visualizations using the available data, including unified naming conventions and simple Python techniques that highlight key insights effectively. 

These files best illustrate how I apply technical expertise and creativity to real-world data challenges.

## üí¨ Notes

This repository can serve as a learning resource or reference for others pursuing the IBM DA Certificate or similar data projects. I included additional steps and improvements in later stages, especially in the final labs, to better understand and present the data.

## üñ•Ô∏è Running Locally (Optional)

> üîπ *Note: If you're just browsing, all `.ipynb` notebooks can be viewed directly on GitHub ‚Äî no need to download anything. Click on any file and it will open automatically in your browser.*

If you want to **run the code locally on your machine**, follow these steps:

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Install Visual Studio Code (VS Code)

* Download and install it from [https://code.visualstudio.com](https://code.visualstudio.com)
* Make sure to install the **Python** and **Jupyter** extensions from the Extensions panel inside VS Code.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Clone This Repository

Open a terminal or Git Bash and run:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/CodeStarter25/IBMDataAnalystCapstone.git
cd IBMDataAnalystCapstone
```

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ (Optional) Set Up a Virtual Environment

While not strictly required, a virtual environment is recommended for keeping dependencies clean.

```bash
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate  # For Windows
# OR
source venv/bin/activate  # For macOS/Linux
```


### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Install Required Python Libraries

Most of the labs require only `pandas`, `numpy`, and `seaborn`, but if you want to run all labs seamlessly, I recommend installing the following libraries using `pip`:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy seaborn matplotlib requests pillow flask pycountry openpyxl
```

> üî∏ `BeautifulSoup` is part of `bs4`, which is often pre-installed in environments like Jupyter, but can be manually installed if needed:

```bash
pip install beautifulsoup4
```

### üîö Notes:

* To exit your virtual environment when done, simply run:

```bash
deactivate
```

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Open in VS Code and Start Exploring

* Launch VS Code and open the cloned folder.
* Open any `.ipynb` file ‚Äî the Jupyter extension will render it like a notebook.
* Run cells interactively or explore the code statically.


> üî∏ If you encounter any issues, make sure your Python and pip versions are up to date.
