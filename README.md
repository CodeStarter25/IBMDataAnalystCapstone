# IBM Data Analyst Capstone

This repository contains the complete work and labs from my **Capstone Project** for the IBM Data Analyst Professional Certificate. It showcases the **skills, techniques, and tools** I‚Äôve developed to **manipulate, clean, and visualize data** throughout the course.


## üìå Project Overview

### üîπ Introduction

As part of this capstone, I assumed the role of a Data Analyst at a global IT and business consulting firm. The company is focused on staying competitive in the rapidly evolving tech landscape by regularly analyzing data to forecast **emerging and in-demand skills**.


### üîπ Role & Responsibilities

My primary objective was to collect, analyze, and visualize data from diverse sources to support this year‚Äôs internal report on in-demand developer skills. Key data sources included:

* Job postings
* Training portals
* Developer surveys (e.g., **Stack Overflow Developer Survey 2024**)

Once collected, I processed the data using **data wrangling**, conducted **exploratory data analysis**, and visualized the results using **Google Looker Studio**. The final deliverables include a presentation highlighting the trends and a dashboard built using BI tools.


## üõ†Ô∏è Skills & Tools Applied

* **Web Scraping** with `BeautifulSoup`
* **REST API** integration
* **Python Libraries**: `Pandas`, `NumPy`, `Seaborn`, `Matplotlib`
* **Data Cleaning** and **Wrangling**
* **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
* **Data Visualization** using:

  * Google Looker Studio
  * Matplotlib & Seaborn (custom plots)
* **Country Standardization** using `pycountry` (Alpha-3 country codes)


## üìä Key Themes Explored

* Most in-demand programming languages
* Popular and emerging database technologies
* Frequently used platforms and web frameworks
* Developer demographics and satisfaction levels
* Global salary and location-based discrepancies


## üí¨ Notes

Feel free to explore this repository as a **learning resource or guide** for completing your own project. I included additional steps and improvements in later stages, especially in the final labs, to better understand and present the data.
